CS 3560 Final Exam

Explanations of screenshots:
Valgrind:
  In the valgrind screenshot we can see that there were no memory leaks in my program.
  All data was handled well.

CPPCheck:
  In my CPPCheck you can see that there were quite a few amount of warnings that it gave me. This is
  because when creating my character arrays I set their size to 50 to account for fairly larger inputs
  that I could have recieved. So when CPPCheck saw that the arrays were not filled seeing how my inputs
  were smaller than size 50, it gave me warnings for each slot that was unused.
